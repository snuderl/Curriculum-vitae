\section{Work experience}

\begin{eventlist}

\item{June 2014 -- August 2014}
     {Tridens, Maribor}
     {RoR development and CI}

My work consisted of two parts. First month I was working on setting up continuous integration for a large Java Enterprise project, that previously had no tests automated tests. I refactored the project to use Maven for the whole process from compiling to deployment. Previously the project could only be run and deployed using Eclipse. I also set up a private Jenkins instance where project was being continuously tested. 
\newline
On my second month I joined a team developing a Ruby on Rails portal for a telecommunications company. My work constituted of mostly back end work. Some of the other stuff I ended working on was search with Solr and using Redis as a background job queue.

\item{July 2013 -- September 2013}
     {Frembassy, Ljubljana}
     {Web developer}
     
I was part of a small team working on a single page web application for a large automotive company. Client side code was written using the AngularJS framework. For back end we used Python running on Google App Engine. My work was evenly split between both front and back end work. I did everything from large code refactoring on the client side to creating new database models and constructing indexes on Google's Datastore.
